My dental hygienist recommended an electric toothbrush, \

pretty impressive so far. After initial charging and \
leaving the charger plugged in for the first week to \
condition the battery, I've unplugged the charger and \
been using it for twice daily brushing for the last \
3 weeks all on the same charge. But the toothbrush head \
is too small. I’ve seen baby toothbrushes bigger than \
this one. I wish the head was bigger with different \
length bristles to get between teeth better because \
this one doesn’t.  Overall if you can get this one \
around the $50 mark, it's a good deal. The manufactuer's \
replacements heads are pretty expensive, but you can \
get generic ones that're more reasonably priced. This \
toothbrush makes me feel like I've been to the dentist \

So, they still had the 17 piece system on seasonal \

around the second week of December the prices all went \
up to about anywhere from between $70-$89 for the same \
system. And the 11 piece system went up around $10 or \
so in price also from the earlier sale price of $29. \
So it looks okay, but if you look at the base, the part \
where the blade locks into place doesn’t look as good \
as in previous editions from a few years ago, but I \
plan to be very gentle with it (example, I crush \
very hard items like beans, ice, rice, etc. in the \ 
blender first then pulverize them in the serving size \
I want in the blender then switch to the whipping \
blade for a finer flour, and use the cross cutting blade \
first when making smoothies, then use the flat blade \
if I need them finer/less pulpy). Special tip when making \
smoothies, finely cut and freeze the fruits and \
vegetables (if using spinach-lightly stew soften the \ 
spinach then freeze until ready for use-and if making \
sorbet, use a small to medium sized food processor) \ 
that you plan to use that way you can avoid adding so \
much ice if at all-when making your smoothie. \
After about a year, the motor was making a funny noise. \
I called customer service but the warranty expired \
already, so I had to buy another one. FYI: The overall \

In a recent survey conducted by the government,

of satisfaction with the department they work at. 
The results revealed that NASA was the most popular 
department with a satisfaction rating of 95%.

One NASA employee, John Smith, commented on the findings, 
stating, "I'm not surprised that NASA came out on top. 
It's a great place to work with amazing people and 
incredible opportunities. I'm proud to be a part of 
such an innovative organization."

The results were also welcomed by NASA's management team, 
with Director Tom Johnson stating, "We are thrilled to 
hear that our employees are satisfied with their work at NASA. 
We have a talented and dedicated team who work tirelessly 
to achieve our goals, and it's fantastic to see that their 
hard work is paying off."

The survey also revealed that the 
Social Security Administration had the lowest satisfaction 
rating, with only 45% of employees indicating they were 
satisfied with their job. The government has pledged to 
address the concerns raised by employees in the survey and
